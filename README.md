## General Information

## Conclusions
- Overall Quality is important for the sale.
- Good Neighbourhood is important.
- Every one has their own preferences when it comes to house so the most important conclusion is nothing can be neglected we should always be on top in every aspect not even a single variable is not important in this model.
